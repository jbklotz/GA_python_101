# Git-Practice

# Steps 

- Fork the page to your own github. 
- Copy the link, click on the file folder. 
- *git clone* [link]

- Let's create and open up a notebook, just to see what the data looks like. 
- Make sure you're able to open the data set. We won't work too much on this. We just want to save and create a Jupyter Notebook file. 
- We should now have what we need to upload a new file. 


- git status
- *git add* [my_first_test_file.txt]
- git commit -m "upload message"
- git push

## What happens when we add or update the page?
- git status 
- git add .
- git commit -m "message"
- git pull
