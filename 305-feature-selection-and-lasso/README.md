_Author:_ Timothy Book, General Assembly DC

By popular demand, this repository contains a lesson on feature selection. No modern discussion of feature selection can go without talking about the LASSO (or other L1ish regularizations), so it is also included.

### Agenda (~1 hour):
Feature selection falls into three broad categories:
1. **Filter Methods**
1. **Wrapper Methods**
    - Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)
1. **Embedded Methods**
    - LASSO
